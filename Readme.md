# Org Docs

A place to track documentation for our organization

## Why?

As a living organiation, we want to have a place where company policy, standards, and style guides are enumerated clearly. Equally as important, we want a place where these policies can be discussed and proposals can be made for modification and extension. Github, with it's versioning, forks, and pull requests, seems to be a decent way of doing this.
