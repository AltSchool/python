# EXPERIMENTAL!!!

The purpose of this repo is to explore the use of github (+github pages) for hosting org-related documentation. For now, it is only being used for coding style guides.

- **read** through the style guides, and find things that are out of date. There are probably several issues there.
- **watch** this repository, so you'll be notified of any proposed changes to the way we do things.
- **fork & PR;** if you have a suggestion about modifying our coding style, we now have a forum to discuss it!

# Org Docs

A place to track documentation for our organization

## Why?

As a living organization, we want to have a place where company policy, standards, and style guides are enumerated clearly. Equally as important, we want a place where these policies can be discussed and proposals can be made for modification and extension. Github, with its versioning, forks, and pull requests, seems to be a decent way of doing this.
